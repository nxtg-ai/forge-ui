## Resource Requirements

- **People:** 1 tester (full-time)
- **Timeline:** 3 weeks
- **Effort:** 59 hours
- **Priority:** CRITICAL (blocks production)

---

## Key Insights

### Insight 1: The Gap is Real
- 58% of code untested
- Not acceptable for production
- Users will find bugs tests miss

### Insight 2: Quality > Quantity
- 611 shallow tests = less value than 200 deep tests
- Focus on coverage depth, not test count

### Insight 3: Tests Need Rewriting
- Problem: Mocking everything
- Solution: Real integration testing

### Insight 4: Critical Path Untested
- User launches app → uses terminal → saves data
- Every step has gaps
- Users experience issues tests didn't catch
