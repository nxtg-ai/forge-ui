## 📋 Prerequisites Checklist

Before we begin, ensure you have:

✅ **Git** installed ([Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
✅ **Claude Desktop** or Claude CLI ([Get Claude](https://claude.ai))
✅ **Node.js 18+** (for JS projects) or **Python 3.8+** (for Python projects)
✅ **5 minutes** of your time
✅ **A project** you want to supercharge (or we'll create one)

## 🎯 Choose Your Path

### Path A: Add Forge to Existing Project
Perfect if you have a project that needs superpowers

### Path B: Start Fresh with Forge
Ideal for new projects or learning Forge

---

## 🛤️ Path A: Supercharge Your Existing Project

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd /path/to/your/amazing/project
```

### Step 2: Initialize NXTG-Forge
```bash
# In Claude, simply type:
/[FRG]-init
```

**What happens:**
- 🔍 Forge analyzes your tech stack
- 📁 Creates `.claude/` structure
- 🤖 Configures specialized agents for your stack
- ⚙️ Sets up automation hooks
- ✨ You're ready to build!

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
/[FRG]-status
```

You'll see:

## 🎯 Real-World Workflows

### Workflow 1: Building a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Start with the feature command
/[FRG]-feature "Add real-time chat with typing indicators"

# 2. Forge will ask clarifying questions:
# - How many users per chat room?
# - Need message persistence?
# - File sharing support?

# 3. Watch the orchestration:
# - Architect designs the solution
# - Developer implements components
# - QA writes tests
# - DevOps updates deployment

# 4. Review and iterate
# Code is ready for review!
```

### Workflow 2: Fixing a Bug

```bash
# Describe the issue
"Users report login fails after password reset.
The error shows 'Invalid token'. Please investigate and fix."

# Forge will:
# 1. Reproduce the issue
# 2. Identify root cause
# 3. Implement fix with tests
# 4. Validate the solution
```

### Workflow 3: Performance Optimization

```bash
# Run optimization command
/[FRG]-optimize database queries

# Forge will:
# 1. Profile current performance
# 2. Identify bottlenecks
# 3. Implement optimizations
# 4. Measure improvements
# 5. Document changes
```

---

## ⚡ Pro Tips

### 1. Be Specific with Requirements
```bash
# Good
/[FRG]-feature "Add user dashboard with charts showing weekly activity,
total tasks completed, and streak counter"

# Less effective
/[FRG]-feature "Add dashboard"
```

### 2. Use Natural Language
```bash
# Forge understands context
"The login page needs better error messages.
Users should know if it's wrong password or account doesn't exist"
```

### 3. Iterate and Refine
```bash
# Start simple
/[FRG]-feature "Basic todo list"

# Then enhance
"Add drag-and-drop reordering to the todo list"

# Then optimize
"Make the todo list real-time with WebSocket updates"
```

### 4. Leverage the Status Command
```bash
# Before starting work
/[FRG]-status

# Understand:
# - Current state
# - Available tools
# - Recent changes
```

### 5. Trust the Process
- Let Forge handle the orchestration
- Review generated code to learn patterns
- Customize agents for your team's style

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjusting Agent Behavior

Edit agent files in `.claude/agents/`:
```markdown
# orchestrator.md
---
style: detailed  # or: concise
approach: conservative  # or: innovative
testing: comprehensive  # or: essential
---
```

### Creating Custom Commands

Add new commands in `.claude/commands/`:
```markdown
# review.md
---
description: Comprehensive code review
category: quality
---

Perform detailed code review focusing on:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style compliance
- Test coverage
```

### Setting Up Hooks

Configure automation in `.claude/hooks/`:
```markdown
# pre-deploy.md
---
trigger: before-deployment
---

Run these checks before any deployment:
1. All tests must pass
2. Coverage must be >80%
3. No security vulnerabilities
4. Documentation is updated
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Commands Not Working

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify .claude folder exists
ls -la .claude/

# Re-initialize if needed
/[FRG]-init
```

### Issue: Tests Failing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Get detailed test output
/[FRG]-test --verbose

# Fix specific test
"Fix the failing authentication test"
```

### Issue: Deployment Problems

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check deployment configuration
/[FRG]-status deployment

# Validate environment
"Verify all deployment environment variables are set"
```
