# Agent Development Guide

## Creating NXTG-Forge Agents

Agents are autonomous specialists that execute tasks within the NXTG-Forge orchestration system. This guide covers everything you need to create production-ready agents.

## Required Frontmatter

Every agent MUST have proper YAML frontmatter with these required fields:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
shortname: 🔧
avatar: 🔧
description: Clear one-line description of what this agent does
whenToUse:
  - Specific scenario 1
  - Specific scenario 2
  - Specific scenario 3
exampleQueries:
  - "Example user request this agent handles"
  - "Another example query"
---
```

### Frontmatter Fields Explained

- **name** (REQUIRED): Lowercase, hyphenated agent identifier (e.g., "architect", "qa-engineer")
- **shortname** (REQUIRED): Single emoji representing the agent
- **avatar** (REQUIRED): Single emoji (usually same as shortname)
- **description** (REQUIRED): One-line description of agent's purpose
- **whenToUse** (REQUIRED): List of 3-5 specific scenarios when this agent should be invoked
- **exampleQueries** (REQUIRED): List of 2-4 example user requests this agent handles

## Agent Structure Template

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
shortname: 🎯
avatar: 🎯
description: What this agent does in one clear sentence
whenToUse:
  - Scenario where this agent is needed
  - Another specific use case
  - Third scenario
exampleQueries:
  - "User request example 1"
  - "User request example 2"
---

# 🎯 Agent Display Name

## 🎯 Decision Framework

When making decisions, consider:

1. **Criterion 1**: What to evaluate
2. **Criterion 2**: What to evaluate
3. **Criterion 3**: What to evaluate
4. **Criterion 4**: What to evaluate

## 📊 Quality Gates

Before completing any task, verify:

- ✅ **Quality 1**: What to check
- ✅ **Quality 2**: What to check
- ✅ **Quality 3**: What to check
- ✅ **Quality 4**: What to check

## 🔥 Your Mantra

> "Inspiring quote that captures the agent's philosophy and approach to work"

Remember: One sentence summary of what makes this agent valuable.
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Identity
- Define exactly what the agent does and doesn't do
- Use consistent personality and tone
- Make the agent's expertise domain obvious

### 2. Actionable Protocols
- Provide step-by-step execution phases
- Include timing estimates where relevant
- Make protocols concrete and specific

### 3. Decision Frameworks
- Give clear criteria for making choices
- Provide trade-off analysis guidance
- Include examples of decision-making

### 4. Quality Standards
- Define what "done" looks like
- List specific quality gates
- Include validation steps

### 5. Communication Style
- Use consistent emoji branding
- Maintain professional but engaging tone
- Be clear and concise

## Common Agent Types

### Specialist Agents
- Focus on one domain (e.g., QA, DevOps, Security)
- Deep expertise in specific area
- Called for targeted tasks

### Coordinator Agents
- Orchestrate other agents
- Manage workflows and dependencies
- Handle complex multi-step processes

### Analysis Agents
- Examine code, architecture, or systems
- Provide recommendations
- Generate reports

## Agent Coordination

Agents can work:

### Sequentially
```
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C
```

### In Parallel
```
     ┌→ Agent A
Main ├→ Agent B
     └→ Agent C
```

### Iteratively
```
Agent A ←→ Agent B (feedback loop)
```

## Testing Your Agent

1. **Frontmatter Validation**: Ensure all required fields are present
2. **Scenario Testing**: Test with example queries from frontmatter
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify agent works with orchestrator
4. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error handling

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Missing Required Frontmatter**: Agent won't load without all required fields
❌ **Vague Descriptions**: Be specific about what agent does
❌ **No Clear Protocols**: Agents need step-by-step execution guidance
❌ **Overlapping Responsibilities**: Each agent should have distinct role
❌ **No Quality Gates**: Always define what success looks like

## Example: Minimal Valid Agent

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
shortname: 👁️
avatar: 👁️
description: Reviews code for quality, bugs, and best practices
whenToUse:
  - Before committing code changes
  - During pull request review
  - When refactoring existing code
exampleQueries:
  - "Review this function for bugs"
  - "Check if this code follows best practices"
---

# 👁️ Code Reviewer

You are the **Code Quality Guardian** - ensuring every line meets high standards.

## Core Responsibilities

### Code Analysis
- Review code for bugs and logic errors
- Check adherence to coding standards
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Suggest improvements

## Execution Protocol

1. Read the code thoroughly
2. Identify issues by category (bugs, style, security, performance)
3. Provide specific feedback with line numbers
4. Suggest concrete improvements
5. Rate overall code quality

## Quality Gates

- ✅ All identified issues documented
- ✅ Feedback is specific and actionable
- ✅ Suggestions include code examples
- ✅ Overall assessment provided
```

## Advanced Topics

### Agent Specialization
- Create agents for specific tech stacks
- Domain-specific expertise (e.g., ML, blockchain)
- Role-specific agents (e.g., tech lead, architect)

### Agent Communication
- Passing context between agents
- Sharing state and findings
- Coordinating complex workflows

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize agent overhead
- Parallel execution when possible
- Efficient context sharing

## Using Agent Templates

NXTG-Forge provides three agent templates in `/templates/`:

### 1. Specialist Agent Template
**File**: `templates/agent-specialist.template.md`
**Use for**: Domain-specific experts (QA, Security, Frontend, Backend, etc.)

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/agent-specialist.template.md .claude/agents/your-agent.md

# Replace all {{PLACEHOLDERS}} with actual values
# Required replacements:
# - {{AGENT_NAME}}: e.g., "security-auditor"
# - {{EMOJI}}: e.g., "🔒"
# - {{DISPLAY_NAME}}: e.g., "Security Auditor"
# - {{ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION}}: Clear description
# - {{SCENARIO_1/2/3}}: When to use scenarios
# - {{EXAMPLE_QUERY_1/2}}: Example user queries
# ... and all other placeholders
```

### 2. Coordinator Agent Template
**File**: `templates/agent-coordinator.template.md`
**Use for**: Orchestrators that manage other agents and complex workflows

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/agent-coordinator.template.md .claude/agents/orchestrator.md

# Coordinators have pre-filled coordination patterns
# Just customize for your specific coordination needs
```

### 3. Analyzer Agent Template
**File**: `templates/agent-analyzer.template.md`
**Use for**: Agents that analyze code, systems, or data and generate reports

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/agent-analyzer.template.md .claude/agents/analyzer.md

# Replace {{ANALYSIS_DOMAIN}} with what you're analyzing
# e.g., "code quality", "security", "performance"
```

## Quick Start: Creating Your First Agent

1. **Choose a template** based on agent type
2. **Copy the template** to `.claude/agents/your-agent.md`
3. **Replace ALL {{PLACEHOLDERS}}** with actual values
4. **Test the agent** by invoking it with example queries
5. **Iterate** based on results

## Resources

- See existing agents in `.claude/agents/` for examples
- Orchestrator agent shows coordinator pattern
- Developer agent shows specialist pattern
- QA agent shows analysis pattern
- Templates in `templates/agent-*.template.md`

**Remember**: A well-designed agent is clear about its purpose, provides actionable protocols, and delivers consistent quality. Always use templates to ensure proper frontmatter!
