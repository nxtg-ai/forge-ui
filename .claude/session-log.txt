- Corrected by delegating to forge-detective before exit

**Next Session Priorities (from forge-detective):**
1. State persistence (45 min) - HIGH PRIORITY
2. Keyboard shortcuts system (1 hour) - HIGH PRIORITY
3. Complete diff backend (1 hour) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
4. Loading states (45 min) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. Accessibility improvements (30 min) - LOW PRIORITY
