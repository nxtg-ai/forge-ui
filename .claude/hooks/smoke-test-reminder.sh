# Smoke Test Reminder Hook
# Triggers on Stop event to remind about real integration testing.
#
# This hook exists because on 2026-02-06, an agent spent an entire day
# writing 2326 mock unit tests while the actual product was broken.
# A duplicate placeholder route intercepted all real requests.
# Nobody caught it because nobody started the actual server.
