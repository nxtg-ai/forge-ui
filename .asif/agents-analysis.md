● Agent Architecture Comparison Complete

  I've completed a comprehensive architectural analysis comparing your two agent
  systems. The ThreeDB (v2) agents are architecturally superior to the current
  NXTG-Forge v3 agents by a significant margin.

  The Verdict: 70-23 Scorecard

  ThreeDB (v2) wins decisively with:
  - 6 specialized agents (1,886 total lines) vs v3's 5 agents (342 lines)
  - 4.6x more detailed implementation guidance
  - 3 critical missing agents in v3: Planner, Detective, Release Sentinel
  - Production-ready workflows vs conceptual guidelines

  Key Architectural Differences

  ThreeDB (v2) Provides:

  ✅ Canonical orchestration - 4-option menu system with explicit workflows✅
  Automated quality gates - Test generation, security scanning, coverage
  tracking✅ Strategic planning - 5-phase feature planning framework✅ Health 
  analysis - Comprehensive project diagnostics with scoring✅ Documentation 
  automation - Code-to-docs synchronization✅ State management - Context
  restoration, checkpoints, error recovery✅ Rich frontmatter - Model
  assignments, tool grants, usage examples with commentary

  NXTG-Forge v3 Provides:

  ⚠️ Generic conceptual guidelines⚠️ Manual checklists without automation⚠️
  Minimal frontmatter metadata⚠️ No state management or error handling⚠️ Missing
  3 critical specialist agents

  Specific Examples

  Quality Assurance:
  - v2 Guardian: 271 lines with test generation, security scanning, Result types
  - v3 QA: 40 lines with basic testing pyramid checklist

  Planning:
  - v2 Planner: 313 lines with requirements gathering, architecture design, task
  breakdown
  - v3: Missing entirely

  Orchestration:
  - v2: Explicit 4-option menu, agent coordination patterns, context restoration
  - v3: Generic coordination concepts, execution protocol phases

  Detailed Reports Created

  I've created two comprehensive analysis documents:

  1. docs/architecture/agent-system-comparison.md (400+ lines)
    - Executive summary with verdict
    - 24-dimension comparison matrix
    - Agent-by-agent deep dive
    - Workflow integration analysis
    - Concrete recommendations
  2. docs/architecture/agent-comparison-summary.md (Quick reference)
    - Scorecard and metrics
    - Critical gaps analysis
    - Three migration options
    - Effort estimates

  Recommended Action: Migrate to v2 Architecture

  Option A (Recommended): Full Migration - 2-4 hours
  - Copy ThreeDB v2 agents to NXTG-Forge v3
  - Add v3's DevOps agent (the one good addition)
  - Update naming conventions for [FRG]- command structure
  - Test orchestration workflows
  - Result: Production-ready agent system immediately

  This gives you v2's operational excellence with v3's modern DevOps focus.
