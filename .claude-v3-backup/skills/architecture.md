## Decision Framework

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Functional requirements
   - Non-functional requirements
   - Constraints and trade-offs

2. **Evaluate Options**
   - List alternatives
   - Pros and cons analysis
   - Risk assessment

3. **Make Decisions**
   - Document in ADRs
   - Define success metrics
   - Plan migration path

4. **Validate Design**
   - Proof of concept
   - Performance testing
   - Security review

## Best Practices

- Start simple, evolve as needed
- Optimize for maintainability
- Design for failure
- Make it observable
- Document everything

Good architecture enables change.
